Recently I visited a zoo in my hometown. It was an awesome experience to be part of the
nature. I saw a lot of tigers, elephants, deer and a whole lot of other [animals](../animal/animal.md)

I was pretty thirsty. There is a lemonade stand over there.
I head over and buy some [lemonade](../drink/lemonade/lemonade.md)

I choose to get better at [English](../get-better-at-english/english.md)

After my self trolling is complete, I decide to drink the lemonade.
As I lift the lemonade to my mouth I see the tigers have broken loose.

During the Spring Festival 2017, a man jumped into the Younger zoo in Ningbo, but he went into tiger area, it was so horrible. He was surrounded by three tigers, and bitten by one tiger to die. In the end, the tiger was killed.
